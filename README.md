# spectroscopy
Code used in analyzing data for the laser spectroscopy system I built during my PhD work

### 11May2025
I have not confirmed whether all of these programs work or which ones are still useful. Unfortunately, I did not use Github at the the time of my PhD so version control was being done manually (saving different versions under new names or adding a date to the program name). I will update this repository as I find time to go through these programs. Further updates WILL be logged in Github (because I want to practice using it anyway).
